# pathfinding-in-graphs-and-mazes
Developed a Java-based pathfinding application utilizing uniform-cost, greedy best-first, and A* search algorithms to navigate through both abstract weighted graphs and maze layouts.

## Input Data
The project uses `.txt` files representing the maps of different cities in France and mazes. Each file details the graph's structure or the maze's layout, which the search algorithms navigate.

## Output
The application prints the path found by each algorithm, including the cost of the path, actions taken, and nodes expanded, explored, and maintained during the search.
